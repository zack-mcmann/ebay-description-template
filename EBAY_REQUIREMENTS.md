# Ebay Policies

Ebay's specific rules and requirements can often be difficult to find via navigation on their website, so I've created a list of policies I need to be aware of here.

- [Item Description Policy](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-policies/item-description-policy?id=4372)
- [Listing Best Practices](https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/listings/listing-best-practices?utm_source=site-map&utm_medium=onsite)
- [Javascript Policy](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-policies/javascript-policy?id=4247)
- [Links Policy](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-policies/links-policy?id=4248)
